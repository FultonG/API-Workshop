# API-Workshop

This TechKnights workshop was done to explain what an API is and how to use them within a web application. The two APIs that are used for this workshop are the [Clarifai API](https://www.clarifai.com/developer/) and the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/)

The web application was built quickly with HTML5, CSS3, and jQuery. I suggest using a framework like Angular (look at this [repository](https://github.com/FultonG/TechKnights-Project-1) to learn how to set up an angular application) for the front end instead but this was done to present the information quickly. The APIs were being authenticated through our node server.
