# API-Workshop

This TechKnights workshop was done to explain what an API is and how to use them within a web application. The two APIs that are used for this workshop are the [Clarifai API](https://www.clarifai.com/developer/) and the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/)

The web application was built quickly with HTMl5, CSS3, and jQuery. I suggest using a framework like Angular for the front end instead but this was done to present the information quickly. The APIs were being authenticated through our node server.
